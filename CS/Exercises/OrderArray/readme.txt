/*
 * Create a function that sorts and returns an array of numbers.
 * - The function will receive a list (for example [2, 4, 6, 8, 9]) and a parameter
 * additional "Asc" or "Desc" to indicate whether it should be sorted from smallest to largest
 * or from highest to lowest.
 * - You cannot use language functions to solve it
 * automatically.
