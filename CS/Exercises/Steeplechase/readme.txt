/*
 * Create a function that evaluates whether an athlete has successfully completed a
 * obstacle course.
 * - The function will receive two parameters:
 * - An array that can only contain String with the words
 * "run" or "jump"
 * - A String that represents the track and can only contain "_" (ground)
 * or "|" (fence)
 * - The function will print how the race finished:
 * - If the athlete does "run" on "_" (ground) and "jump" on "|" (fence)
 * will be correct and the symbol for that part of the track will not change.
 * - If you "jump" on "_" (floor), the track will be varied by "x".
 * - If you do "run" on "|" (fence), the track will be changed to "/".
 * - The function will return a Boolean that indicates whether it has passed the race.
 * To do this you have to make the correct option in each section of the track.
