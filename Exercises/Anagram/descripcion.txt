/*
 * Write a function that takes two words (String) and returns
 * true or false (Bool) depending on whether or not they are anagrams.
 * - An Anagram consists of forming a word by rearranging ALL of them
 * the letters of another initial word.
 * - It is NOT necessary to check that both words exist.
 * - Two exactly the same words are not an anagram.
